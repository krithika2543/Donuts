This is my first attempt in scratch. I have built a level-based adventure game where the player controls a cat using the keyboard to move and jump through different environments like the jungle and underwater levels. The goal is to collect donuts to increase the score while avoiding dangers such as spiders and sea animals, which reduce the score if touched. The space bar or arrow keys are used to jump, and the cat must reach specific lines to move between levels. Sound effects and messages guide the player, making the game interactive and engaging.
